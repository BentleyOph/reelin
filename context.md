## 6. Feature Interdependencies

- **AI Video Creation** ↔ **Content Generation**  
  - Script generation heavily relies on the LLM. The voiceover feature depends on the script.  
  - AI images or video clips also depend on textual prompts generated during the script creation.

- **Editing Tools** ↔ **Video & Audio Generation**  
  - Once the audio track and video clips are generated, the editing tools rely on these assets to function properly.

- **Scheduling & Posting** ↔ **Finalized Media**  
  - Scheduling can only happen once a project has a complete video.  
  - The posting feature might require a completed reel with valid audio and video.

## 8. Assumptions and Open Questions

### Assumptions

1. **AI Accuracy**: The LLM can reliably generate relevant scripts from user-provided ideas.  
2. **Media Storage**: The app stores generated video/audio in the user’s project library until deleted.  
3. **Social Media API Access**: The app is authorized to post directly to Instagram and TikTok on behalf of the user.  
4. **Editing Tools**: Basic editing tools (trim, cut, subtitle edits) are sufficient. More advanced editing (e.g., color correction, advanced transitions) may be out of scope initially.  
5. **Monetization**: There could be a subscription model for advanced features or premium voice options, though not specified in the workflows.

### Open Questions

1. **Access Levels**: Are there any special Admin workflows for approving or moderating generated content?  
2. **File Export**: Besides direct posting, will users want to export the final reel to their device in a specific format (MP4, MOV, etc.)?  
3. **Additional Editing Features**: Is there a need for advanced overlays, filters, or interactive elements in the reel?  
4. **Analytics**: Do we show analytics (views, engagement) within the app, or is that data only accessible via the social platforms?  
5. **Team Collaboration**: Will multiple users collaborate on a single project, or is it single-user only?

---

## Additional Suggestions

1. **Simple Project Management**: Consider adding a feature to organize multiple projects with tags or categories.  
2. **Template Library**: Offer prebuilt templates for certain types of reels (e.g., product promos, travel vlogs).  
3. **Multi-Platform Posting**: Expand scheduling to other platforms (YouTube Shorts, Facebook).  
4. **User Education**: Provide short tutorial videos or tooltips to guide new users through the AI generation process.  
5. **Voice Variations**: Allow pitch/speed adjustments for voiceovers to give users more creative control.
